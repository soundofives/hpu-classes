    "The McIntyre text discusses a modification of the experiment presented above in which $\\hat{S}^{x}$ is still <i>analyzed</i>, but the beams are not split. This is subtly different from what occurs in the last exercises in which we obtained measurement information but did not <i>store</i> it. As we'll see, forcing the quantum state into a well-defined value of (say) $\\hat{S}^{x}$ is what has such spooky consequences for the notion of the operator $\\hat{S}^{z}$ having a \"well-defined\" value.\n",
    "\n",
    "What we would like to do in this last exploration is to analyze $\\hat{S}^{x}$ after peeling off the subset of unpolarized spins with $S^{z} = \\frac{1}{2}$ without actually measuring $\\hat{S}^{x}$. To accomplish this, we will modify the <b>measure_op()</b> so that while it does split the state <b>v</b> into a linear superposition of $\\left|+\\right\\rangle_{x}$ and $\\left|-\\right\\rangle_{x}$, it does not <i>project</i> the state onto one of these eigenstates through a measurement that returns either $S^{x} = \\frac{1}{2}$ or $S^{x} = -\\frac{1}{2}$.\n",

    "Take out <b>val</b> from the return command so it just reads \"<b>return vf</b>.\" This will ensure that the function only returns the state after being analyzed. The remainder of the code writes the input state as a combination of eigenstates of the operator being measured (or now, analyzed).

This process is equivalent to Experiment 4(c) in the text in which the beams are recombined after passing through an analyzer of $\\hat{S}^{x}$ without actually performing a measurement. Of the initial number of spins with $S^{z} = \\frac{1}{2}$, how many do you expect to return a value $S^{z} = -\\frac{1}{2}$?"
